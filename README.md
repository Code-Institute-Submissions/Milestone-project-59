 ## Testing

 1.  http://ami.responsivedesign.is/  has been used to see how the site performs on different Apple devices and their viewports, all pages, links, icons performed as expected on all devices. I also used it to create the AppleDevicesView.png at the top of this Readme.

 2.  **Desktop**
     
       * Google Chrome, Internet Edge & Mozilla Firefox browsers; all pages, links on those pages, and footer icon links perform well on all viewport sizes. Developer tools were also used on all browsers for the various viewport sizes.

 3.  **Mobile**

      *  Used iPhone6 plus, as well as relative's iPhone X, Android smartphones to test;  all pages, links, icons performed well on all devices using various browsers; Safari & Chrome.      
  



         
## Deployment

  1. Created a Github account at https://github.com
  My account url;    https://github.com/nax977

  2. I uploaded all files to my Github repository located at this url;  https://github.com/nax977/Milestone-project   which is for this individual project.

  3. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages. Under the Source setting, I used the drop-down menu to select master branch as a publishing source and saved it.  Refreshed the github page, and you are then given a url where your page is published;
   Your site is published at https://github.com/nax977/Milestone-project/

  4.  To run this code on your local machine, you would go to my respository at 
https://github.com/nax977/Milestone-project   and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
"Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
To continue with cloning, you would;
  * Open Git Bash
  * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  * Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/nax977/Milestone-project.git     Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
